# About AI Design Prompts

**AI Design Prompts** is an interactive learning platform designed specifically for non-frontend programmers, product managers, and designers.

## 🎯 My Mission

In the modern software development process, the gap between "backend logic" and "frontend presentation" often leads to communication costs. My goal is to bridge this gap by providing:

- **Visualized Design Terms**: Understand abstract concepts like "Flexbox" or "Grid" through interactive demos.
- **Ready-to-use Code**: Copy-paste production-ready HTML/CSS snippets.
- **Design Inspiration**: Explore curated UI styles like "Cyberpunk" or "Neumorphism".

## 👥 Who is this for?

1.  **Backend Developers**: Who want to build decent UIs for their side projects but struggle with CSS.
2.  **Product Managers**: Who need to describe their requirements more precisely to the design/eng team.
3.  **Full-stack Developers**: Who need quick inspiration and reference for UI patterns.
4.  **Design Beginners**: Who want to learn the technical implementation behind visual designs.

## 🚀 Key Features

### 📚 Interactive Vocabulary
A comprehensive dictionary of UI/UX terms. Each term comes with:
- **Interactive Playground**: Tweak parameters and see changes in real-time.
- **Code Snippets**: Clean, semantic HTML and CSS.
- **Best Practices**: When to use it and when to avoid it.

### 🎨 Style Gallery
A collection of trending and classic design styles.
- **Full Page Previews**: See how a style applies to a real landing page.
- **Theme Configuration**: Colors, typography, and spacing variables.
- **Magic Prompts**: AI prompts to generate similar designs.

## 🛠 Tech Stack

This project is built with modern web technologies:
- **Next.js 14**: For server-side rendering and static generation.
- **Tailwind CSS**: For utility-first styling.
- **MDX**: For writing content mixed with React components.
- **TypeScript**: For type safety.
