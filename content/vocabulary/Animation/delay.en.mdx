# Animation Delay

The **animation-delay** property defines the waiting time before the animation starts.

## Property Values

*   **Time**: Positive values (e.g., `2s`) mean waiting 2 seconds before starting.
*   **Negative Values**: Negative values (e.g., `-1s`) cause the animation to start immediately, but begin from the 1-second mark of the animation sequence (as if it had already been playing for 1 second).

```css
.wait {
  animation-delay: 2s;
}

.jump-start {
  animation-delay: -1s;
}
```

## Sequential Animation

By setting incremental `animation-delay` values for a group of elements, you can create elegant entrance sequences.
