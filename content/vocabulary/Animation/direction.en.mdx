# Animation Direction

The **animation-direction** property defines the direction of the animation playback.

## Property Values

1.  `normal`: Default. The animation plays normally.
2.  `reverse`: The animation plays in reverse.
3.  `alternate`: The animation is played forwards first, then backwards.
4.  `alternate-reverse`: The animation is played backwards first, then forwards.

```css
.yo-yo {
  animation-direction: alternate;
}
```

`alternate` is commonly used to create smooth looping effects (like breathing lights), avoiding abrupt jumps back to the start when the animation ends.
