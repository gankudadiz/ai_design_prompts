> Visual changes that occur when a user moves their cursor over an element.

## Usage

Hover effects are crucial for indicating interactivity on desktop devices. They tell the user that an element is clickable or active.

## Examples

### Scale on Hover

```css
.card {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.card:hover {
  transform: scale(1.05);
}
```

### Color Change and Underline

```css
.link {
  color: #333;
  text-decoration: none;
  border-bottom: 2px solid transparent;
  transition: all 0.3s;
}

.link:hover {
  color: #007bff;
  border-bottom-color: #007bff;
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Speed**: Keep transitions snappy (e.g., 0.2s - 0.4s).
- **Feedback**: Ensure the change is noticeable enough to be effective.
- **Mobile**: Remember that hover effects don't work on touch devices; don't rely on them for critical functionality.
