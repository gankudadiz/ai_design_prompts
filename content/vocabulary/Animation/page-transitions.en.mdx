> Animations that occur when navigating between pages or views.

## Usage

Page transitions smooth out the experience of moving between different parts of an application. They help maintain context and reduce cognitive load.

## Examples

### Fade Transition

```css
/* Using a library like Framer Motion or Vue Transitions */
.fade-enter-active, .fade-leave-active {
  transition: opacity 0.5s;
}
.fade-enter, .fade-leave-to {
  opacity: 0;
}
```

### Slide Transition

```css
.slide-enter-active {
  transition: transform 0.3s ease-out;
}
.slide-enter-from {
  transform: translateX(100%);
}
.slide-enter-to {
  transform: translateX(0);
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Duration**: Keep transitions short (e.g., < 0.5s) to avoid slowing down navigation.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent transitions throughout the application.
- **Performance**: Optimize for 60fps to ensure smoothness.
