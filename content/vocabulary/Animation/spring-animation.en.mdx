> Animations based on spring physics, creating natural and fluid motion.

## Usage

Spring animations mimic real-world physics, making interfaces feel more responsive and alive. They are often used for:

- Drag and drop interactions
- Modals and popups
- Toggle switches

## Examples

### Concept (React Spring / Framer Motion)

```javascript
// Using a library like React Spring
useSpring({
  to: { opacity: 1, y: 0 },
  from: { opacity: 0, y: 100 },
  config: { tension: 170, friction: 26 }
})
```

### CSS Approximation (Cubic Bezier)

```css
.bounce {
  transition: transform 0.5s cubic-bezier(0.175, 0.885, 0.32, 1.275);
}

.bounce:hover {
  transform: scale(1.2);
}
```

## Best Practices

- **Realism**: Adjust tension and friction to match the "weight" of the UI element.
- **Overshoot**: A slight overshoot adds character, but too much can feel sloppy.
- **Consistency**: Use consistent physics parameters across the application.
