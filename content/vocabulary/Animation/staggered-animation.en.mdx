> A technique where a group of elements animate one after another with a slight delay.

## Usage

Staggered animations are used to reveal lists, grids, or groups of elements in a pleasing and organic way.

## Examples

### CSS Stagger

```css
.item {
  opacity: 0;
  animation: fadeIn 0.5s forwards;
}

.item:nth-child(1) { animation-delay: 0.1s; }
.item:nth-child(2) { animation-delay: 0.2s; }
.item:nth-child(3) { animation-delay: 0.3s; }

@keyframes fadeIn {
  to { opacity: 1; }
}
```

### JavaScript Stagger (GSAP)

```javascript
gsap.from(".box", {
  duration: 1,
  y: 100,
  opacity: 0,
  stagger: 0.1 // 0.1s between each element's start time
});
```

## Best Practices

- **Delay**: Keep the delay small (e.g., 0.05s - 0.1s) to prevent the animation from dragging on.
- **Direction**: Stagger from top to bottom or left to right, following natural reading patterns.
- **Grouping**: Apply stagger to logical groups of items.
