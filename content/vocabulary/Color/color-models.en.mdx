# Color Models

Color models define how colors are represented in a computer. Understanding different models helps developers choose the best representation for their specific use case.

## Core Models

### 1. RGB (Red, Green, Blue)
*   **Basis**: Additive color mixing of light.
*   **Use Case**: Hardware displays (screens).
*   **Drawback**: Not intuitive; it's hard to adjust values to make a color "a bit brighter" or "more vivid".

### 2. HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness)
*   **Basis**: Human perception of color.
    *   **Hue**: The type of color (0-360 degrees).
    *   **Saturation**: The purity of the color.
    *   **Lightness**: How bright or dark the color is.
*   **Use Case**: Design systems, dynamic color adjustment.

### 3. LCH / OKLCH (Lightness, Chroma, Hue)
*   **Basis**: Perceptually uniform color space.
*   **Advantage**: Solves the issue where HSL colors have inconsistent visual lightness (e.g., pure yellow looks much brighter than pure blue in HSL, but OKLCH values reflect this human perception).
*   **Use Case**: Modern web design, accessible design.

## Comparison

| Model | Intuitiveness | Perceptual Uniformity | Browser Support |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **RGB** | Low | Low | Excellent |
| **HSL** | High | Medium | Excellent |
| **OKLCH**| High | High | Good (Modern) |
