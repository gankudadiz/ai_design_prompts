# currentColor

`currentColor` is a CSS keyword that resolves to the computed value of the element's (or inherited) `color` property. It's incredibly useful for making borders, shadows, or SVG icons automatically match the text color.

## Key Use Cases

### 1. Border matches Text
Make a button's border automatically match its text color.

```css
.button {
  color: blue;
  border: 1px solid currentColor; /* Border is also blue */
}
.button:hover {
  color: red; /* On hover, both text and border turn red */
}
```

### 2. SVG Icon Fill
This is the most powerful use case for `currentColor`.

```css
.icon {
  fill: currentColor;
}
```
```html
<div style="color: green">
  <!-- This icon automatically becomes green -->
  <svg class="icon">...</svg>
</div>
```

### 3. Inheritance & Components
When building components, using `currentColor` allows them to adapt flexibly to different context colors without hardcoding.
