# Hex (Hexadecimal Color)

Hex codes are a hexadecimal shorthand for RGB values. They start with a `#` followed by 3, 4, 6, or 8 hexadecimal characters.

## Format Details

### 1. 6 Digits (#RRGGBB) - Most Common
Each pair represents a color channel (00 to FF).
*   `#FF0000` = Red
*   `#000000` = Black
*   `#FFFFFF` = White

### 2. 3 Digits (#RGB) - Shorthand
If both characters in each pair are the same, they can be shortened.
*   `#F00` is equivalent to `#FF0000`
*   `#333` is equivalent to `#333333` (Dark Gray)

### 3. With Alpha (#RRGGBBAA or #RGBA)
The last characters represent the Alpha channel (transparency).
*   `#00000080` = Black with 50% opacity (80 is hex for 128, roughly half of 255).

## Pros & Cons
*   **Pros**: Short, compact, excellent compatibility.
*   **Cons**: Hard to read. It's difficult to know what color `#4287f5` is just by looking at it (it's a shade of blue), and hard to adjust brightness manually.
