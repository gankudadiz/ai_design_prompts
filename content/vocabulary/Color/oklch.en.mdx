# OKLCH

OKLCH is the most advanced color function in CSS today. It solves the inconsistent perceptual lightness of HSL and can define wide-gamut colors (like neons) outside the sRGB space.

## Syntax
`oklch(lightness chroma hue)`

### Parameters
1.  **Lightness (L)**: 0% (Black) - 100% (White). **Advantage**: The same L value means the same perceived brightness to the human eye, regardless of color.
2.  **Chroma (C)**: Purity/Vividness. 0 is gray, around 0.4 is usually extreme saturation (theoretically unbounded, but limited by screens).
3.  **Hue (H)**: Hue angle (0-360).

## Why OKLCH?

### 1. Perceptual Uniformity
In HSL, Yellow (`hsl(60, 100%, 50%)`) looks much brighter than Blue (`hsl(240, 100%, 50%)`) even though they share the same Lightness value.
In OKLCH, if you set the same L value, they are visually equally bright. This is crucial for accessibility and auto-generating palettes.

### 2. Wide Gamut
OKLCH can access vivid colors in the P3 gamut that traditional Hex and RGB cannot reach.

## Example

```css
.neon-element {
  /* A very vivid P3 wide-gamut pink */
  color: oklch(60% 0.25 340);
  
  /* Gray with the exact same perceptual lightness */
  background-color: oklch(60% 0 0);
}
```
