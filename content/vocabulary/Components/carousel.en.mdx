> A **Carousel** is a slideshow component for cycling through a series of content, like images or text slides.

## Anatomy
-   **Slides**: The content items.
-   **Navigation**: Arrows (Previous/Next) to move between slides.
-   **Indicators**: Dots or bars showing the current position and total number of slides.

## Usage
-   **Hero Sections**: Showcasing featured products or news.
-   **Image Galleries**: Browsing through a set of photos.
-   **Testimonials**: Displaying customer reviews.

## Accessibility Concerns
-   **Auto-play**: Can be distracting and hard for screen reader users. Always provide a pause button.
-   **Focus Management**: Ensure keyboard users can navigate through slides.

## Best Practices
-   **Don't hide important info**: Users often ignore carousels (banner blindness).
-   **Limit slides**: Keep the number of slides low (3-5 max).
