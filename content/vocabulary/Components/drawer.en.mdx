> A **Drawer** is a panel that slides out from the edge of the screen (left, right, top, or bottom). It typically sits on top of the page content.

## Usage
-   **Mobile Navigation**: The "hamburger menu" usually opens a drawer.
-   **Details Panel**: Viewing details of an item selected in a list without leaving the list context.
-   **Configuration**: Settings panels or filters.

## Behavior
-   **Modal**: Blocks interaction with the background (has an overlay/backdrop).
-   **Non-modal**: Allows interaction with the background content.

## Best Practices
-   **Position**: Use right drawers for details/actions and left drawers for navigation.
-   **Focus Trap**: Ensure keyboard focus stays within the drawer while it's open (for modal drawers).
