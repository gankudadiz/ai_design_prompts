> A **Dropdown** is a toggleable menu that allows the user to choose one value from a predefined list. It helps conserve screen space by hiding options until they are needed.

## Anatomy
-   **Trigger**: The button or element that opens the menu.
-   **Menu**: The container holding the list of options.
-   **Items**: The individual options within the menu.

## Usage
-   **Navigation**: Grouping related links (e.g., "Solutions" menu).
-   **Actions**: Grouping secondary actions (e.g., "Edit," "Delete," "Share").
-   **Forms**: Selecting a single option from a list (often using the `<select>` element).

## Best Practices
-   **Clear Label**: The trigger should clearly indicate what the dropdown contains.
-   **Hover vs. Click**: Click-to-open is generally more accessible and mobile-friendly than hover-to-open.
