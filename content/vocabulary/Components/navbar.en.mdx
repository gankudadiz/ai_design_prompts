> A **Navbar** (Navigation Bar) is a section of a graphical user interface intended to aid users in accessing information. It typically appears at the top of a page.

## Anatomy
-   **Brand**: Logo or site name.
-   **Links**: Primary navigation items.
-   **Actions**: Search bar, user profile, or call-to-action buttons.
-   **Mobile Menu**: Hamburger icon for smaller screens.

## Types
-   **Sticky**: Stays fixed at the top as the user scrolls.
-   **Fixed**: Always visible at the top of the viewport.
-   **Static**: Scrolls away with the page content.

## Best Practices
-   **Simplicity**: Keep top-level items to a minimum (usually 5-7).
-   **Consistency**: Keep the navbar consistent across all pages.
-   **Responsiveness**: Ensure it collapses gracefully into a mobile menu on smaller screens.
