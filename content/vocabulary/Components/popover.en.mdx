> A **Popover** is a floating card that provides detailed information or actions relative to a specific element. It is similar to a Tooltip but can contain more complex content (title, text, links, buttons).

## Anatomy
-   **Trigger**: The element that triggers the popover.
-   **Arrow**: Points to the trigger element.
-   **Body**: The content container.

## Usage
-   **Onboarding**: Explaining a feature.
-   **User Profiles**: Showing user details when clicking an avatar.
-   **Contextual Help**: Providing definitions or extra info.

## Interaction
-   **Click**: Toggles visibility (recommended for mobile and interactive content).
-   **Hover**: Shows on mouse enter, hides on leave (good for desktop info-only).

## Best Practices
-   **Positioning**: Ensure it doesn't go off-screen.
-   **Dismissal**: Allow clicking outside (backdrop click) or pressing Esc to close.
