> An input field that allows users to query and filter content.

## Usage

Search components help users find specific content within a large dataset or website. They can range from simple input boxes to complex filters.

## Examples

### Simple Search Bar

```html
<div class="search-bar">
  <input type="search" placeholder="Search...">
  <button type="submit">
    <span class="icon-search">🔍</span>
  </button>
</div>
```

## Best Practices

- **Placement**: Place the search bar in a prominent location (e.g., top header).
- **Placeholder**: Use a helpful placeholder text.
- **Auto-complete**: Provide suggestions as the user types to speed up the process.
- **Results**: Display results clearly and allow for filtering/sorting.
