> A **Sidebar** is a vertical column typically placed to the left or right of the main content area. It is commonly used for navigation, filtering, or displaying supplementary information.

## Usage
-   **Dashboard Navigation**: Primary navigation for web applications.
-   **Blog Widgets**: Recent posts, categories, tags, or search.
-   **E-commerce Filters**: Price ranges, categories, and attributes.
-   **Table of Contents**: Helping users navigate long articles.

## States
-   **Expanded**: Fully visible with labels and icons.
-   **Collapsed**: Only icons are visible (rail navigation).
-   **Off-canvas**: Hidden by default and slides in when triggered (common on mobile).

## Best Practices
-   **Hierarchy**: Use indentation or headings to show structure.
-   **Active State**: Clearly indicate the current page or section.
