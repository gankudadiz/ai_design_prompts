> A **Skeleton** (or Skeleton Screen) is a placeholder used to display the layout of content while the actual data is loading. It mimics the shape of the content (text, images, avatars).

## Benefits
-   **Perceived Performance**: Makes the app feel faster than a blank screen or a spinner.
-   **Visual Stability**: Prevents large layout shifts (CLS) when content loads.

## Usage
-   **Lists**: Showing skeleton rows in a table.
-   **Cards**: Showing skeleton boxes for images and lines for text.
-   **Profiles**: Showing a circle for the avatar and rectangles for details.

## Animation
-   **Pulse**: The skeleton gently fades in and out.
-   **Wave**: A gradient moves across the skeleton to indicate activity.

## Best Practices
-   **Match Layout**: The skeleton should closely match the final layout to avoid layout shifts.
-   **Short Duration**: Use for short loading times (< 3s). For longer waits, a progress bar might be better.
