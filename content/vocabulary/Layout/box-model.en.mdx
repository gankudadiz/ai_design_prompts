# Think of it like a Picture Frame

Imagine every element on a webpage is a **picture frame** hanging on a wall.

1.  **Content**: The photo itself.
2.  **Padding**: The matting (space) between the photo and the frame.
3.  **Border**: The physical frame itself.
4.  **Margin**: The space between this frame and other frames on the wall.

## Why does my layout break?

A common headache for beginners is: *"I set the width to 100px, but after adding a border, it got bigger!"*

This is because by default, CSS uses the **Standard Box Model**:
> Width = Content Width only

It's like ordering a frame based on the photo size. If you add a thick frame around it, the total size increases, and it might not fit in the space you planned.

### The Modern Solution: border-box

Modern developers usually use `box-sizing: border-box`. This is like telling the shop: "I want the **total** frame width to be 100px." No matter how thick the frame or matting is, the total size stays locked at 100px.

```css
/* Recommended Setup */
* {
  box-sizing: border-box;
}
```
