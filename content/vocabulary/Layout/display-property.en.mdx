# The Personality of Elements

If HTML elements were people, the `display` property would be the gene determining their social behavior. It decides whether an element likes to **stand alone** or **mingle with others**.

## Core Values

### 1. Block - The Loner
Elements with `display: block` are like "loners".
- **New Line**: They always start on a new line and take up the full width available.
- **Resizable**: You can set their `width` and `height` freely.
- **Examples**: `<div>`, `<p>`, `<h1>`, `<section>`

```css
.box {
  display: block;
  width: 100%; /* Defaults to full width */
}
```

### 2. Inline - The Follower
Elements with `display: inline` go with the flow.
- **Same Line**: They only take up as much width as necessary and sit inline with other content.
- **Fixed Size**: Setting `width` and `height` has **no effect**.
- **Vertical Constraints**: Vertical margins and padding usually don't push other elements away.
- **Examples**: `<span>`, `<a>`, `<em>`

```css
.text {
  display: inline;
  /* width: 100px;  <-- Ignored */
  /* height: 50px; <-- Ignored */
}
```

### 3. Inline-Block - The Hybrid
`display: inline-block` offers the best of both worlds.
- **Externally**: It sits on the same line like an `inline` element.
- **Internally**: It respects `width` and `height` like a `block` element.
- **Use Cases**: Buttons, navigation items, grid cards.

```css
.button {
  display: inline-block;
  width: 120px;
  height: 40px;
}
```

### 4. None - The Ghost
`display: none` removes the element from the document flow entirely.
- **No Space**: It takes up no space, as if it never existed.
- **vs Visibility**: `visibility: hidden` hides the element but keeps the empty space it occupied.

## Modern Layout Modes

Beyond the basics, `display` is also the gateway to modern layout systems:

- `display: flex`: Enables Flexbox layout.
- `display: grid`: Enables Grid layout.
