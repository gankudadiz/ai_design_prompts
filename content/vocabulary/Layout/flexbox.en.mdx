# What is Flexbox?

**Flexbox** (Flexible Box) is a one-dimensional layout model. It offers powerful capabilities for space distribution and alignment between items in a container.

## Key Concepts

Flexbox layout consists of two parts:
1. **Flex Container**: The parent element with `display: flex`
2. **Flex Items**: The direct children of the container

## Common Properties

### Container Properties (Flex Container)

```css
.container {
  display: flex; /* Enable flex layout */
  flex-direction: row; /* Main axis direction: row | row-reverse | column | column-reverse */
  justify-content: center; /* Main axis alignment: flex-start | flex-end | center | space-between | space-around */
  align-items: center; /* Cross axis alignment: stretch | flex-start | flex-end | center | baseline */
}
```

### Item Properties (Flex Items)

```css
.item {
  flex: 1; /* Shorthand for flex-grow: 1; flex-shrink: 1; flex-basis: 0% */
  align-self: flex-end; /* Overrides align-items of the container */
}
```

## Use Cases

*   **Vertical Centering**: Previously required `position` + `transform`, now just `justify-content: center` + `align-items: center`.
*   **Grid Systems**: While Grid is better for 2D, Flexbox is great for simple rows or columns.
*   **Holy Grail Layout**: Fixed header, footer, and fluid center.

> **Tip**: Always remember Flexbox is **one-dimensional**. If you need to control both rows and columns (two-dimensional), consider using **CSS Grid**.
