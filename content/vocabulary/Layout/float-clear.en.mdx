# Floating Boxes

Imagine a newspaper layout: an image sits on the left, and text wraps tightly around its right side and bottom. This is exactly what `float` was created for.

## Core Concepts

### 1. Float
When an element is floated, it shifts to the left or right until it touches the edge of its container or another floated element.
- `float: left`: Floats to the left.
- `float: right`: Floats to the right.
- `float: none`: Default, no floating.

**Key Behavior**: A floated element is removed from the normal document flow (partially). Text content is aware of it and wraps around it, but block-level parent containers "ignore" it, often leading to collapsed height.

### 2. Clear
The `clear` property specifies whether an element can have floating elements beside it.
- `clear: left`: No floating elements allowed on the left side.
- `clear: right`: No floating elements allowed on the right side.
- `clear: both`: No floating elements allowed on either side (most common).

## The Classic Problem: Height Collapse

If a parent container contains *only* floated children, its height collapses to 0. This is because the children are "floating" and don't push the parent open.

### The Solution: Clearfix

This is one of the most famous hacks in web development history, used to fix height collapse:

```css
/* Modern Clearfix Hack */
.clearfix::after {
  content: "";
  display: table;
  clear: both;
}
```

## When to Use?

- **✅ Recommended**: For wrapping text around images (magazine style).
- **❌ Not Recommended**: For main page layout structures (use Flexbox or Grid instead).
