# The Scales of the Web

In the real world, we measure with meters or inches. In the CSS world, we have more choices, and choosing the right "ruler" determines whether your layout is rigid or flexible.

## 1. Absolute Units: px (Pixel)
- **Definition**: A single point on the screen (logical pixel).
- **Trait**: Fixed. If you set `200px`, it stays `200px` forever.
- **Use Case**: Borders, dimensions that must be fixed due to design constraints, minimum sizes (`min-width`).

## 2. Font-Relative Units: em & rem
These units are based on font size, allowing the layout to scale with text.

- **em**: Relative to the **parent element's** font size.
  - Pitfall: Compounding effect in nested structures (1.2 * 1.2 * 1.2...), making it hard to predict.
- **rem (Root em)**: Relative to the **root element's (html)** font size.
  - **Recommended**: Most modern responsive typography uses `rem`. If a user changes their browser's default font size, the whole page scales proportionally.

```css
html { font-size: 16px; }
.box {
  width: 10rem; /* = 160px */
  padding: 1rem; /* = 16px */
}
```

## 3. Viewport Units: vw, vh
Based on the size of the **browser window (Viewport)**.

- **vw (Viewport Width)**: 1% of the viewport width. `100vw` = Full width.
- **vh (Viewport Height)**: 1% of the viewport height. `100vh` = Full height.
- **Use Case**: Full-screen Hero Sections (`height: 100vh`), responsive typography.

## 4. Container-Relative Units: %
- **Definition**: Relative to the **immediate parent element**.
- **Trait**: `width: 50%` means half the width of the parent.
- **Note**: `height: 50%` often requires the parent to have an explicit height to work.

## Best Practices

| Scenario | Recommended | Reason |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Layout Width** | `%`, `max-width` | Adapts to screens |
| **Spacing (Padding/Margin)** | `rem` | Breathes with font size |
| **Font Size** | `rem` | Respects user settings |
| **Borders** | `px` | Fine control needed |
| **Full-screen Backgrounds** | `vh`, `vw` | Fills the viewport |
