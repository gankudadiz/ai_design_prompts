# Read Like a Newspaper

Reading a single line of text that spans a wide monitor is exhausting. CSS Multi-column Layout allows content to automatically split into multiple columns, mimicking traditional newspaper or magazine layouts.

## Core Properties

### 1. column-count
Specifies the number of columns. The browser calculates the width of each column automatically.

```css
.newspaper {
  column-count: 3; /* Split into 3 columns */
}
```

### 2. column-width
Specifies the ideal width for columns. The browser automatically determines how many columns fit in the container. This is often more responsive than fixing the count.

```css
.newspaper {
  column-width: 300px; /* Each column is at least 300px wide */
}
```

### 3. column-gap
Controls the space between columns.

```css
.newspaper {
  column-gap: 40px;
}
```

### 4. column-rule
Adds a dividing line between columns, similar to the `border` syntax.

```css
.newspaper {
  column-rule: 1px solid #ccc;
}
```

### 5. column-span
Allows an element (like a headline) to span across all columns.

```css
h2 {
  column-span: all;
}
```

## Difference from Grid/Flexbox

- **Grid/Flexbox**: Primarily for **Layout Structure** (e.g., Sidebar + Main Content). They control the position of "boxes".
- **Multi-column**: Primarily for **Content Typography**. It controls how "text flow" moves inside a container. When one column is full, content naturally spills into the next.

## Use Cases

- Blog post bodies
- Legal terms and conditions
- Dictionaries or index lists
- Pure CSS Masonry layouts (simple version)
