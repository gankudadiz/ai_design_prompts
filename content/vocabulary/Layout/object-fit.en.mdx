# Stop Stretching My Photos!

In responsive design, we often assign fixed dimensions to image containers (like card thumbnails), but the actual images come in various aspect ratios. Forcing width and height causes **distortion**. `object-fit` is the savior.

## Core Values

### 1. fill (Default)
**"Force fit."**
- The image is stretched to fill the container exactly.
- **Result**: Distorted aspect ratio (squashed or stretched).

### 2. contain
**"Show everything."**
- Scales the image to fit within the container while maintaining its aspect ratio.
- **Result**: The whole image is visible, but there might be empty space (letterboxing) in the container.

### 3. cover (Most Popular)
**"Fill and Crop."**
- Scales the image to fill the container while maintaining its aspect ratio.
- **Result**: No empty space, no distortion, but parts of the image are cropped out.
- **Use Case**: Full-screen backgrounds, avatars, card thumbnails.

```css
.card-image {
  width: 100%;
  height: 200px;
  object-fit: cover; /* Perfect fit */
}
```

### 4. none
**"Original size."**
- The image retains its original dimensions and is not resized. It just gets cropped by the container.

## Partner with Object-position

When `object-fit: cover` crops an image, it defaults to the center. You can use `object-position` to change the focal point.

```css
img {
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: top center; /* Focus on the top, crop the bottom */
}
```
