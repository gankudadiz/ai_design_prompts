# When the Box is Too Small

If you try to stuff a large winter coat into a small suitcase, parts of it will stick out. In web layout, this is called **Overflow**. The `overflow` property decides how to handle this "sticking out" content.

## Core Values

### 1. visible (Default)
**"Let it flow."**
- Content spills outside the container box, potentially overlapping other elements.
- This is the default behavior to ensure content is never hidden by accident.

### 2. hidden
**"Cut it off."**
- Content that overflows is **clipped** (hidden).
- Users cannot scroll to see the clipped content.
- Use cases: Circular avatars (with `border-radius`), clearing floats, hiding edges of decorative elements.

### 3. scroll
**"Always scroll."**
- Scrollbars are added whether content overflows or not.
- Rarely used, as scrollbars are ugly when not needed.

### 4. auto (Recommended)
**"Scroll if needed."**
- Scrollbars appear only if the content overflows.
- This is the standard way to create scrollable areas (like sidebars or chat windows).

```css
.sidebar {
  height: 100vh;
  overflow-y: auto; /* Scroll vertically only if needed */
}
```

## Text Overflow

For single-line text, we often want to show an ellipsis (...) when text is too long. This requires a trio of properties:

```css
.truncate {
  white-space: nowrap;      /* 1. Force single line */
  overflow: hidden;         /* 2. Hide overflow */
  text-overflow: ellipsis;  /* 3. Show '...' */
}
```
