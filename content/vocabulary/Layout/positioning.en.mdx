# Where did my element go?

By default, HTML elements appear one after another, like people in a queue (Document Flow). But sometimes you want to "pin" an element to the corner, or float it on top of others. That's where `position` comes in.

## The 5 Modes Explained Simply

### 1. static (Default)
**"Follow the Rules"**
The element sits in the normal flow. You cannot move it with `top` or `left`.

### 2. relative
**"Ghost Shift"**
The element keeps its original seat (space reserved), but its "ghost" (visual appearance) shifts a bit.
*   **Use for**: Nudging things, or creating a reference point for `absolute` children.

### 3. absolute
**"Cut Ties"**
The element leaves the queue entirely. It occupies no space. It positions itself relative to its nearest "positioned" ancestor.
*   **Use for**: Dropdown menus, notification badges, overlays.

### 4. fixed
**"Stuck to Screen"**
It stays glued to the browser window, no matter how much you scroll.
*   **Use for**: Back-to-top buttons, fixed headers.

### 5. sticky
**"Hybrid"**
It acts like `relative` until you scroll past it, then it becomes `fixed` (stuck) to the edge.
*   **Use for**: Table headers, alphabet index in contact lists.
