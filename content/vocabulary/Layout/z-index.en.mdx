# Who's on Top?

Imagine stacking **pancakes** or **playing cards** on a table.
`z-index` is simply the number that decides which card is on top.

*   `z-index: 1`: Bottom layer.
*   `z-index: 999`: Top layer.

## Two Rules to Remember

### 1. Only "Positioned" Elements get a Z-Index
A common mistake is giving a normal `div` a `z-index: 9999` and seeing no change.
**Reason**: You must set `position: relative` (or absolute/fixed/sticky) for `z-index` to work.

### 2. The "Parent Rule" (Stacking Context)
If your parent element is on a low layer, you (the child) cannot escape that layer, even if your `z-index` is one million.

**Analogy**:
*   **Group A** (Z-Index: 1)
    *   Mike (Z-Index: 999)
*   **Group B** (Z-Index: 2)
    *   Sarah (Z-Index: 1)

Because Group B > Group A, **Sarah** will sit on top of **Mike**. Mike is the king of Group A (999), but because his group is at the bottom of the pile, he stays at the bottom.
