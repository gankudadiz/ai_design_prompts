# What is Bento Grid?

**Bento Grid** is one of the hottest UI trends (popularized by Apple and Linear).
The core philosophy is: **Everything is a box.**

It's perfect for Dashboards or Feature Sections on landing pages.
The aesthetic comes from the fact that while boxes vary in size, the overall structure is tightly packed and organized.

## Implementation

CSS Grid is the best tool for this. Use `grid-column: span X` and `grid-row: span Y` to control the size of each cell.

```css
.bento-container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(4, 1fr); /* 4 columns */
  grid-auto-rows: 100px; /* Base row height */
  gap: 16px;
}

/* A large 2x2 box */
.item-large {
  grid-column: span 2;
  grid-row: span 2;
}

/* A tall 1x2 box */
.item-tall {
  grid-column: span 1;
  grid-row: span 2;
}
```
