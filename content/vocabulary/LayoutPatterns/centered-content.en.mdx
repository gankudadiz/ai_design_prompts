# Centered Content

The **Centered Content** layout places the main element exactly in the center of the screen, both horizontally and vertically. This pattern is commonly used for login pages, error pages (404), or minimalist landing pages.

## Implementation

The most modern and concise method uses CSS Grid or Flexbox.

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  place-items: center; /* Centers both horizontally and vertically */
  height: 100vh;
}
```

Or using Flexbox:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
  height: 100vh;
}
```
