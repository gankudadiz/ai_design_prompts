# Hero Section

A **Hero Section** is the first visual element a visitor encounters on a webpage. It typically occupies a large portion of the viewport and serves to grab attention, convey the core value proposition, and guide user action.

<LayoutPatternDemo type="hero" />

## Implementation

The Hero Section is usually implemented using Flexbox or CSS Grid to center content vertically and horizontally over a background image or color.

```css
.hero {
  height: 80vh; /* Occupies most of the viewport height */
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center; /* Horizontal centering */
  justify-content: center; /* Vertical centering */
  text-align: center;
  background-size: cover;
  background-position: center;
}
```
