# What is the Holy Grail Layout?

The "Holy Grail Layout" is named so because it was once considered elusive and hard to implement perfectly (especially before Flexbox and Grid).

It consists of:
1.  **Header**: Top section (usually 100% width).
2.  **Center**: Middle section with three columns:
    *   **Main Content**: The primary content (usually in the middle, and appears first in HTML for SEO).
    *   **Nav**: Left navigation.
    *   **Aside**: Right sidebar.
3.  **Footer**: Bottom section (usually 100% width).

**Key Requirements**:
*   All three middle columns should have equal height.
*   The center (main) column should be fluid (responsive), while side columns are fixed width.
*   The footer should always stick to the bottom.

## Modern Implementation (Flexbox)

With modern CSS, implementing this is trivial using Flexbox.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

header, footer {
  height: 60px; /* Fixed height */
}

.main-body {
  display: flex;
  flex: 1; /* Fill remaining space */
}

nav, aside {
  width: 200px; /* Fixed width */
}

main {
  flex: 1; /* Fluid width */
}
```

## Historical Context

Before Flexbox, developers used complex hacks involving `float`, negative `margin`, and `padding` to achieve this (often called "Double Wing" layout variants in some communities). Now, we can forget those hacks and embrace Flexbox and Grid.
