# Media Object

The **Media Object** is a classic and versatile layout pattern consisting of a fixed-width media element (image, avatar, icon) positioned alongside content. It is the building block for comment threads, tweets, and news feeds.

## Implementation

Flexbox is the best tool for the job, handling alignment and spacing with ease.

```css
.media {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start; /* Align to top */
  gap: 1rem;
}

.media-figure {
  flex: none; /* Prevent image shrinking */
  width: 64px;
}

.media-body {
  flex: 1; /* Take up remaining space */
}
```
