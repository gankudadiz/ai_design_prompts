# Off-Canvas Menu

The **Off-Canvas Menu** (or Drawer) hides navigation links outside the viewport until triggered by the user. This pattern is ubiquitous on mobile devices for saving screen space.

<LayoutPatternDemo type="off-canvas" />

## Implementation

Use `position: fixed` to place the menu off-screen, and control its visibility with the `transform` property.

```css
.off-canvas-menu {
  position: fixed;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 250px;
  height: 100vh;
  transform: translateX(-100%); /* Initially hidden */
  transition: transform 0.3s ease;
}

.off-canvas-menu.is-open {
  transform: translateX(0); /* Slide in to show */
}
```
