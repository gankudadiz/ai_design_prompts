# What is Parallax Scrolling?

**Parallax Scrolling** is a classic web effect.
As the user scrolls, background layers move slower than foreground layers. This speed difference tricks the brain into perceiving depth on a 2D screen.

It is often used for:
*   Immersive storytelling.
*   High-end brand showcases.

## Interactive Demo

## Pure CSS Implementation

While JS was traditionally required, we can now achieve high-performance parallax with pure CSS:

```css
.parallax-container {
  height: 100vh;
  overflow-y: auto;
  overflow-x: hidden;
  perspective: 1px; /* Key: Enable 3D perspective */
}

.bg-layer {
  position: absolute;
  top: 0;
  left: 0;
  width: 100%;
  height: 100%;
  /* Key: Push back and scale up */
  transform: translateZ(-1px) scale(2); 
  z-index: -1;
}
```

Principle: Objects further from the "camera" (negative Z-axis) appear to move slower when scrolling.
