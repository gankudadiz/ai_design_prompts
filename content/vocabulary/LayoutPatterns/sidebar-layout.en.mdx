# What is Sidebar Layout?

This is the standard layout for modern Web Applications (especially Dashboards and Admin Panels).
It typically features a fixed navigation menu on the left and a main workspace on the right.

## Interactive Demo

<LayoutPatternDemo type="sidebar" />

## Key Features

1.  **Independent Scrolling**: Often, you want the sidebar and main content to scroll independently.
2.  **Responsive**: On mobile devices, the sidebar usually hides and becomes a "Hamburger Menu".

## Implementation

CSS Grid makes this very easy:

```css
.container {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 250px 1fr; /* Fixed 250px left, fluid right */
  min-height: 100vh;
}

/* Mobile Adaptation */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    grid-template-columns: 1fr; /* Single column */
  }
  aside {
    display: none; /* Or become a drawer menu */
  }
}
```
