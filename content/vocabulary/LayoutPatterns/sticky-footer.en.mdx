# What is a Sticky Footer?

Have you ever seen a page with very little content, where the footer floats awkwardly in the middle of the screen, leaving a huge blank space below it?

**Sticky Footer** solves this. It ensures:
1.  If content is long, the footer is pushed down and appears after scrolling.
2.  If content is short, the footer "sticks" to the very bottom of the screen.

## Interactive Demo

## How to implement?

The easiest way is using Flexbox.

```css
body {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  min-height: 100vh; /* Key: Minimum height equals viewport height */
}

main {
  flex: 1; /* Key: Main content stretches to fill available space */
}
```

With just these lines, the `main` area acts like a spring, pushing the `footer` to the bottom.
