# Sticky Sidebar

The **Sticky Sidebar** pattern keeps sidebar content fixed within the viewport as the user scrolls through the main content. This is highly effective for tables of contents, filter options, or advertisements in long articles.

## Implementation

The core technique relies on `position: sticky` and the `top` property.

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  align-items: flex-start; /* Critical: prevents height stretching */
}

.sidebar {
  position: sticky;
  top: 20px; /* Offset from the top */
  height: auto;
}
```
