> The **`aspect-ratio`** CSS property sets a preferred aspect ratio for the box, which will be used in the calculation of auto sizes and some other layout functions.

## Syntax
```css
/* width / height */
aspect-ratio: 16 / 9;
aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;
aspect-ratio: 0.5;
```

## Key Features
-   **Responsiveness**: Helps maintain element proportions (like images or video containers) as the viewport resizes.
-   **Simplification**: Replaces the old "padding-top hack" for creating responsive squares or rectangles.

## Use Cases
-   Responsive video embeds (e.g., 16:9).
-   Product cards with consistent image dimensions.
-   Avatar placeholders.
