> The **`clip-path`** CSS property creates a clipping region that sets what part of an element should be shown. Parts that are inside the region are shown, while those outside are hidden.

## Syntax
```css
clip-path: circle(50%);
clip-path: polygon(50% 0%, 0% 100%, 100% 100%);
clip-path: path('M0.5,1 C0.5,1,0,0.7,0,0.3 A0.25,0.25,1,1,1,0.5,0.3 A0.25,0.25,1,1,1,1,0.3 C1,0.7,0.5,1,0.5,1 Z');
```

## Key Shapes
-   **Basic Shapes**: `circle()`, `ellipse()`, `polygon()`, `inset()`.
-   **SVG Paths**: `path()` for complex custom shapes.
-   **Geometry Box**: Uses the element's box model (e.g., `padding-box`).

## Use Cases
-   Creating non-rectangular images (hexagons, stars).
-   Creative reveal animations.
-   Removing backgrounds visually without editing the image file.
