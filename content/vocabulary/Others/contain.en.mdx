> The **`contain`** CSS property allows an author to indicate that an element and its contents are, as much as possible, independent of the rest of the document tree.

## Syntax
```css
contain: none;
contain: strict;
contain: content;
contain: size;
contain: layout;
contain: style;
contain: paint;
```

## Key Values
-   **`strict`**: Applies all containment rules (layout, style, paint, size).
-   **`content`**: Applies layout, style, and paint containment (but not size).
-   **`layout`**: Isolates the internal layout from the rest of the page.
-   **`paint`**: Ensures the element doesn't paint outside its bounds.

## Use Cases
-   **Widgets**: Ensuring a third-party widget doesn't affect the page layout.
-   **Performance**: Optimizing rendering for large lists or complex UIs by limiting the scope of recalculations.
