> The **`mask`** CSS property hides an element (partially or fully) by masking or clipping the image at specific points.

## Syntax
```css
mask: url(mask.png);
mask: linear-gradient(black, transparent);
```

## How it Works
-   **Luminance Mask**: White areas are visible, black areas are hidden, and gray areas are semi-transparent.
-   **Alpha Mask**: Opaque areas are visible, transparent areas are hidden.

## Use Cases
-   Fading out images at the edges.
-   Applying texture overlays.
-   Complex reveal effects using gradients.
