> A **Pseudo-class** is a keyword added to a selector that specifies a special state of the selected element(s).

## Syntax
```css
selector:pseudo-class {
  property: value;
}
```

## Common Pseudo-classes
-   `:hover`: Applies when the user interacts with an element with a pointing device.
-   `:active`: Applies while an element is being activated (e.g., clicked).
-   `:focus`: Applies when an element has received focus.
-   `:first-child`: Matches an element that is the first child of its parent.
-   `:nth-child()`: Matches elements based on their position in a group of siblings.
-   `:not()`: Matches elements that do not match a list of selectors.

## Use Cases
-   Styling links and buttons on interaction.
-   Alternating row colors in tables.
-   Form validation styling (`:valid`, `:invalid`).
