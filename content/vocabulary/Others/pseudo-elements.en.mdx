> A **Pseudo-element** is a keyword added to a selector that lets you style a specific part of the selected element(s).

## Syntax
```css
selector::pseudo-element {
  property: value;
}
```
*Note: Double colon (`::`) is the modern syntax, though single colon (`:`) is supported for backward compatibility for some.*

## Common Pseudo-elements
-   `::before`: Creates a pseudo-element that is the first child of the selected element.
-   `::after`: Creates a pseudo-element that is the last child of the selected element.
-   `::first-line`: Styles the first line of a block-level element.
-   `::first-letter`: Styles the first letter of the first line of a block-level element.
-   `::selection`: Styles the portion of a document that has been highlighted by the user.
-   `::placeholder`: Styles the placeholder text of an input element.

## Use Cases
-   Adding decorative content (icons, shapes) without changing HTML.
-   Styling drop caps.
-   Customizing text selection colors.
