> The **`will-change`** CSS property hints to browsers how an element is expected to change. This allows the browser to set up optimizations before an element is actually changed.

## Syntax
```css
will-change: auto;
will-change: scroll-position;
will-change: contents;
will-change: transform;
will-change: opacity;
```

## Best Practices
-   **Use Sparingly**: Overuse can cause the browser to waste resources and actually degrade performance.
-   **Remove When Done**: Apply it shortly before the change occurs and remove it after the change is complete (via JavaScript).
-   **Don't Prematurely Optimize**: Only use it when you are experiencing performance issues (like jank).

## Use Cases
-   Smooth animations of complex elements (e.g., `transform`, `opacity`).
-   Improving scrolling performance for fixed elements.
