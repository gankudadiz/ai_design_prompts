# Beyond the Viewport

Traditional Media Queries (`@media`) can only detect the size of the **browser window**. However, in modern component-based development, the same component (like a "Product Card") might be placed in a wide main column or a narrow sidebar.

**Container Queries (`@container`)** allow a component to adapt its style based on the width of **its container**. This makes components truly "write once, run anywhere."

## Core Syntax

### 1. Define the Container

First, you must tell CSS which element is the "container". Usually done with `container-type`.

```css
.card-container {
  /* Define this as a query container, looking at inline-size (width) */
  container-type: inline-size;
  
  /* Optional: Name the container */
  container-name: product-wrapper;
}
```

### 2. Query the Container

Then, child elements can adjust their styles based on the container's width.

```css
.card {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
}

/* Switch to row layout when container is wider than 400px */
@container (min-width: 400px) {
  .card {
    flex-direction: row;
  }
}
```

## Vs Media Queries

- **Media Queries**: "If the **screen** is wide, change styles." -> Macro Layout.
- **Container Queries**: "If **my parent** is wide, change styles." -> Micro Components.

## Browser Support

Container Queries are a modern CSS feature, now well-supported in major browsers (Chrome 105+, Safari 16+, Firefox 110+). They are the future standard for building Design Systems.
