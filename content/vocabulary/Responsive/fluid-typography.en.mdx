# No More Jumps

In traditional responsive design, we often set font sizes like this:
- Mobile: 16px
- Tablet: 18px
- Desktop: 24px

This causes the font size to "jump" instantly at breakpoints. **Fluid Typography** makes text size scale smoothly like water as the screen width changes.

## The Ultimate Weapon: `clamp()`

The `clamp()` function takes three arguments: a minimum value, a preferred value, and a maximum value.

```css
h1 {
  /* 
    Minimum: 2rem (32px)
    Preferred: 5vw (5% of viewport width)
    Maximum: 4rem (64px)
  */
  font-size: clamp(2rem, 5vw, 4rem);
}
```

- **On narrow screens**: Font size won't go below `2rem`, ensuring readability.
- **On wide screens**: Font size won't exceed `4rem`.
- **In between**: Font size equals `5vw`, growing linearly with the screen.

## Precision Control

If you want the font size to scale exactly from 16px to 24px between screen widths of 320px and 1200px, you can use `calc()` mixed units:

```css
/* This complex calculation is usually done via SCSS functions or online generators */
body {
  font-size: clamp(1rem, 0.8rem + 1vw, 1.5rem);
}
```

Fluid typography works not just for `font-size`, but also for `padding`, `margin`, and `gap`, allowing the layout's "breathing room" to expand and contract naturally.
