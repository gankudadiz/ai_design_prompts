# One Size Does Not Fit All

Loading a 4K desktop wallpaper on a mobile phone wastes data and slows down your page. **Responsive Images** allow browsers to automatically select the most appropriate image resource based on the current device's screen width and pixel density (DPR).

## 1. Resolution Switching

Use `srcset` and `sizes` when the image content is the same, but you need different sizes.

```html
<img
  src="small.jpg"
  srcset="small.jpg 500w,
          medium.jpg 1000w,
          large.jpg 1500w"
  sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw,
         (max-width: 1200px) 50vw,
         33vw"
  alt="Responsive demo"
/>
```

- **srcset**: Tells the browser what images are available and their intrinsic width (w descriptor).
- **sizes**: Tells the browser how wide the image will be on the screen at different breakpoints.
- **Browser Decision**: The browser calculates `Required Pixels = Slot Width * DPR` and picks the closest sufficient match from `srcset`.

## 2. Art Direction

Use the `<picture>` element when you need to show **different crops** or **aspect ratios** on different screens (e.g., a wide panorama on desktop, a square close-up on mobile).

```html
<picture>
  <!-- Mobile: Show square close-up -->
  <source media="(max-width: 799px)" srcset="product-square.jpg" />
  <!-- Desktop: Show wide panorama -->
  <source media="(min-width: 800px)" srcset="product-wide.jpg" />
  <!-- Fallback -->
  <img src="product-wide.jpg" alt="Product shot" />
</picture>
```

## 3. Pixel Density (Retina Displays)

Serve 2x or 3x images for high-resolution screens (like MacBook Retina, iPhone).

```html
<img 
  src="logo-1x.png" 
  srcset="logo-1x.png 1x, logo-2x.png 2x" 
  alt="High-res Logo" 
/>
```

## Best Practices

1.  **Always keep `src`**: As a fallback for older browsers that don't support `srcset`.
2.  **Don't over-optimize**: Usually 3-4 sizes (e.g., 640w, 1024w, 1920w) are enough.
3.  **Use modern formats**: Combine with `<source type="image/webp">` to serve WebP/AVIF for smaller file sizes.
