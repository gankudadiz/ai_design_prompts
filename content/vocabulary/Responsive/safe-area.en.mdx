# The Notch Era

On modern smartphones (especially since iPhone X), the screen is no longer a perfect rectangle. There are notches, "Dynamic Islands," rounded corners, and home indicator bars. If your webpage fills the entire screen, key buttons might be obscured.

The **Safe Area** is the rectangular portion of the screen that is guaranteed to be unobstructed by these physical constraints.

## 1. Enable Full-Screen Coverage

First, tell the browser your page is ready to expand to the full screen (including under the notch):

```html
<meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover">
```

The key is `viewport-fit=cover`. Without this, browsers will default to adding white bars (letterboxing) to avoid the notch.

## 2. Respect the Insets

CSS provides `env()` variables to get the safe area inset values:

- `safe-area-inset-top`: Top inset (avoids notch/status bar)
- `safe-area-inset-bottom`: Bottom inset (avoids home indicator)
- `safe-area-inset-left` / `right`: Side insets for landscape mode

### Example: Fixed Bottom Bar

```css
.fixed-bottom-bar {
  position: fixed;
  bottom: 0;
  width: 100%;
  
  /* Add padding so content doesn't touch the edge or sit under the home bar */
  padding-bottom: env(safe-area-inset-bottom);
  
  /* Fallback for older iOS */
  padding-bottom: constant(safe-area-inset-bottom); 
}
```

This way, your page delivers an immersive full-screen experience while keeping interactive elements safe and usable.
