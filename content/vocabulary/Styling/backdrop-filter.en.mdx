> The **`backdrop-filter`** CSS property lets you apply graphical effects such as blurring or color shifting to the area behind an element. Because it applies to everything *behind* the element, to see the effect you must make the element or its background at least partially transparent.

## Syntax
```css
backdrop-filter: blur(10px);
backdrop-filter: brightness(60%);
backdrop-filter: contrast(40%);
backdrop-filter: drop-shadow(4px 4px 10px blue);
backdrop-filter: grayscale(30%);
```

## Browser Support Note
Requires vendor prefixes (`-webkit-backdrop-filter`) on some older Safari versions.

## Use Cases
-   **Glassmorphism**: Creating the popular "frosted glass" effect on cards or sidebars.
-   **Overlay Readability**: Dimming or blurring the background behind a modal or text to make it more readable.
