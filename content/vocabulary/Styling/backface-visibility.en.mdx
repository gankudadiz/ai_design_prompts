> The **`backface-visibility`** CSS property sets whether the back face of an element is visible when turned towards the user.

## Syntax
```css
backface-visibility: visible;
backface-visibility: hidden;
```

## Use Cases
-   **Card Flips**: When creating a double-sided card (front and back), you set `backface-visibility: hidden` on both sides so that when the "front" is rotated 180 degrees, you see through it to the "back" element (or hide it so the back element can be seen).
-   **Hiding Content**: Hiding the back of an element when it rotates away from the viewer.

## Example Scenario
For a card flip effect:
1.  Container with `perspective`.
2.  Inner wrapper with `transform-style: preserve-3d`.
3.  Front and Back faces, both with `backface-visibility: hidden`.
4.  Back face rotated `rotateY(180deg)` initially.
