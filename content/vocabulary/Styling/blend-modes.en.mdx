> **Blend Modes** define how the colors of an element interact with the colors of the content behind it.

## Key Properties
-   **`mix-blend-mode`**: Blends an element with its parent/backdrop.
-   **`background-blend-mode`**: Blends a background image with the background color or other background images of the same element.

## Common Modes
-   `multiply`: Multiplies the numbers for each pixel (always darker).
-   `screen`: Multiplies the inverse of the numbers (always lighter).
-   `overlay`: Combines Multiply and Screen.
-   `darken`: Selects the darker of the two colors.
-   `lighten`: Selects the lighter of the two colors.
-   `difference`: Subtracts the darker color from the lighter color.

## Use Cases
-   Colorizing black and white images.
-   Creating text effects where text takes on the texture of the background.
-   Complex visual overlays.
