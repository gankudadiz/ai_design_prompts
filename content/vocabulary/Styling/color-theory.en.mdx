# Color Theory

**Color Theory** is a set of rules and guidelines for communicating with color. In UI design, it's crucial for establishing brand identity and guiding user attention.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Color Wheel
*   **Primary Colors**: Red, Blue, Yellow.
*   **Secondary Colors**: Green, Orange, Purple (mixed from primary).
*   **Tertiary Colors**: Mixed from primary and secondary.

### 2. Color Harmonies
*   **Monochromatic**: Variations of a single hue.
*   **Analogous**: Colors next to each other on the wheel.
*   **Complementary**: Colors opposite each other (high contrast).

## CSS Implementation

In modern CSS, we often use HSL (Hue, Saturation, Lightness) for easier color manipulation.

```css
:root {
  --primary-hue: 200;
  --primary: hsl(var(--primary-hue), 100%, 50%);
  --primary-light: hsl(var(--primary-hue), 100%, 70%);
  --primary-dark: hsl(var(--primary-hue), 100%, 30%);
}
```
