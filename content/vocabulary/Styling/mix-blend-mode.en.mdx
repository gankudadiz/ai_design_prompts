> The **`mix-blend-mode`** CSS property sets how an element's content should blend with the content of the element's parent and the element's background.

## Syntax
```css
mix-blend-mode: normal;
mix-blend-mode: multiply;
mix-blend-mode: screen;
mix-blend-mode: overlay;
mix-blend-mode: difference;
```

## Key Concept
-   **Stacking Context**: To limit the blending to specific elements (and not the whole page background), you often need to create a new stacking context on a wrapper using `isolation: isolate`.

## Use Cases
-   **Text effects**: Making text change color based on the background image behind it (e.g., `difference` mode).
-   **Graphics**: Creating complex visual compositions directly in CSS.
