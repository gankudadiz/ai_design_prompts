> The **`opacity`** CSS property sets the opacity of an element. Opacity is the degree to which content behind an element is hidden, and is the opposite of transparency.

## Syntax
```css
opacity: 1;   /* Fully opaque (visible) */
opacity: 0.5; /* 50% transparent */
opacity: 0;   /* Fully transparent (invisible) */
```

## Behavior
-   **Inheritance**: Opacity applies to the element and *all* of its children. You cannot make a child more opaque than its parent using this property.
-   **Events**: Elements with `opacity: 0` still occupy space in the layout and can still receive user interactions (clicks, etc.), unlike `visibility: hidden` or `display: none`.

## Use Cases
-   Fading elements in or out (animations).
-   Creating ghost buttons or disabled states.
-   Overlaying text on images.
