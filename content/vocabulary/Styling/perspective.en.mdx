> The **`perspective`** CSS property determines the distance between the z=0 plane and the user in order to give a 3D-positioned element some perspective.

## Syntax
```css
/* Applied to the parent container */
perspective: 1000px;
```

## How it Works
-   **Lower value**: Stronger perspective (more distortion), closer to the viewer.
-   **Higher value**: Weaker perspective (flatter), further from the viewer.
-   **None**: No 3D effect (orthographic projection).

## Related Properties
-   `perspective-origin`: Determines the position at which the viewer is looking.

## Use Cases
-   3D cube animations.
-   Parallax scrolling effects.
-   Card flip interactions.
