> The **`transform-origin`** CSS property sets the origin for an element's transformations.

## Syntax
```css
/* x-offset | y-offset */
transform-origin: center;
transform-origin: top left;
transform-origin: 50% 50%;
transform-origin: 0px 0px;
```

## How it Works
-   By default, the origin is at the center of the element (`50% 50%`).
-   Changing the origin affects how `rotate()`, `scale()`, and `skew()` behave. For example, rotating from the `top left` corner looks very different from rotating from the `center`.

## Use Cases
-   Swinging a sign (origin at top center).
-   Opening a door (origin at left or right edge).
-   Scaling an element up from a specific point.
