> The **`transform-style`** CSS property sets whether children of an element are positioned in the 3D space or are flattened in the plane of the element.

## Syntax
```css
transform-style: flat;
transform-style: preserve-3d;
```

## Key Values
-   **`flat`** (Default): Children are flattened into the element's 2D plane. 3D rotations of children won't work as expected relative to each other.
-   **`preserve-3d`**: Children maintain their own 3D position. Essential for building 3D objects like cubes.

## Use Cases
-   Building complex 3D scenes or objects (cubes, tetrahedrons).
-   Nested 3D animations.
