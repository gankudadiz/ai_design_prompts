# letter-spacing

The `letter-spacing` property controls the amount of space between characters in a block of text. It is used to fine-tune the density and texture of typography.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Usage cases
*   **Uppercase Text**: All-caps text is often harder to read; adding letter spacing improves legibility significantly.
*   **Large Headings**: Very large text often benefits from slightly reduced spacing (negative values) to look tighter and more cohesive.
*   **Body Text**: Usually left at `normal` unless for a specific stylistic effect.

### 2. Units
Can use `px`, `em`, etc.
*   **em**: Recommended, as it scales relative to the font size.

## CSS Implementation

```css
.text-element {
  /* Default */
  letter-spacing: normal;

  /* Increased spacing (Good for Uppercase) */
  text-transform: uppercase;
  letter-spacing: 0.05em;  /* Slightly loose */
  letter-spacing: 2px;     /* Fixed pixels */

  /* Decreased spacing (Good for Large Headings) */
  letter-spacing: -0.02em; /* Slightly tight */
}
```

## Visual Examples

*   **NORMAL**: Standard spacing
*   **W I D E**: `letter-spacing: 0.3em`
*   **TIGHT**: `letter-spacing: -0.05em`
