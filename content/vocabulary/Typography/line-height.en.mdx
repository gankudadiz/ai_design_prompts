# line-height

The `line-height` property defines the amount of space above and below inline elements. Proper line height is essential for readability, especially in blocks of text.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Unitless Number (Recommended)
Using a number without a unit (e.g., `1.5`) is the best practice. It acts as a multiplier of the current font size.
E.g., `font-size: 16px` and `line-height: 1.5` results in a line height of `24px`.
**Benefit**: Child elements inherit the multiplier, not the computed pixel value, avoiding layout issues when font sizes change.

### 2. Absolute Units (px, rem)
Sets a fixed line height.
**Drawback**: If a child element changes its font size, a fixed line height might cause lines to overlap or look too cramped.

### 3. Percentage (%)
Similar to unitless, but inheritance behavior can differ (often inherits the computed value).

## CSS Implementation

```css
.text-element {
  /* Best Practice: Unitless */
  line-height: 1.5;   /* Standard for body text */
  line-height: 1.2;   /* Headings are usually tighter */
  line-height: 1.6;   /* Relaxed reading experience */

  /* Not Recommended */
  line-height: 24px;
}
```

## Design Tips
*   **Body Text**: Usually set between `1.4` and `1.6` for optimal readability.
*   **Headings**: Larger text usually needs a tighter line height, often between `1.1` and `1.3`.
