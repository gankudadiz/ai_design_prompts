# text-align

The `text-align` property sets the horizontal alignment of content within a block element or table-cell box. It does not control the alignment of block elements themselves, only their inline content.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Common Values
*   **left**: Aligns the text to the left edge (default for LTR languages).
*   **right**: Aligns the text to the right edge.
*   **center**: Centers the text.
*   **justify**: Stretches the lines so that each line has equal width (like in newspapers).

### 2. start and end (Recommended)
For better internationalization support (e.g., Right-to-Left languages):
*   **start**: Same as `left` in LTR, `right` in RTL.
*   **end**: Same as `right` in LTR, `left` in RTL.

## CSS Implementation

```css
.text-element {
  /* Basic Alignment */
  text-align: left;
  text-align: center;
  text-align: right;

  /* Justified (Newspaper style) */
  text-align: justify;
  
  /* Internationalization Friendly (Recommended) */
  text-align: start;
  text-align: end;
}
```

## Notes
*   `text-align` is an inherited property.
*   It affects inline content (text, images, spans) but not block-level children (unless they are `inline-block`).
