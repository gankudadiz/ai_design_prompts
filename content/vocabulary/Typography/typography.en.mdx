# Typography

**Typography** is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language legible, readable, and appealing when displayed.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Typeface vs Font
*   **Typeface**: The design of lettering (e.g., Roboto, Helvetica).
*   **Font**: The specific file or variation (e.g., Roboto Bold, Helvetica Italic).

### 2. Hierarchy
Using size, weight, and color to signal the importance of content elements.
*   **Headings**: Large and bold to grab attention.
*   **Body Text**: Optimized for readability.
*   **Captions**: Smaller text for auxiliary information.

### 3. Leading & Tracking
*   **Leading** (line-height): The vertical space between lines of text.
*   **Tracking** (letter-spacing): The horizontal space between characters.

## CSS Implementation

```css
.typography-example {
  /* Font Family */
  font-family: 'Inter', sans-serif;
  
  /* Size & Line Height */
  font-size: 1rem;      /* 16px */
  line-height: 1.5;     /* 150% - Good for body text */
  
  /* Weight */
  font-weight: 500;     /* Medium */
  
  /* Spacing */
  letter-spacing: -0.02em; /* Slightly tighter */
}
```
