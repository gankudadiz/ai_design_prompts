# white-space

The `white-space` property controls how white space (spaces, tabs) and line breaks within an element are handled.

## Key Concepts

### 1. Common Values
*   **normal**: Default. Sequences of white space are collapsed. Text wraps when necessary.
*   **nowrap**: Sequences of white space are collapsed. Text does **not** wrap (unless `<br>` is present) and may overflow.
*   **pre**: White space is preserved (like the `<pre>` tag). Text only wraps at line breaks in the source.
*   **pre-wrap**: White space is preserved. Text wraps at line breaks and when necessary.
*   **pre-line**: Sequences of white space are collapsed. Text wraps at line breaks and when necessary.

## CSS Implementation

```css
.text-element {
  /* Default behavior */
  white-space: normal;

  /* Single line text (Often used for truncation) */
  white-space: nowrap;
  overflow: hidden;
  text-overflow: ellipsis;

  /* Preserve formatting (e.g., code blocks or poetry) */
  white-space: pre-wrap;
}
```

## Use Cases
*   **nowrap**: Used for buttons or single-line headings to prevent awkward breaks.
*   **pre-wrap**: Used for displaying user-generated content (like comments or code snippets) where line breaks matter.
