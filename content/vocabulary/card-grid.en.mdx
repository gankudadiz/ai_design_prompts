# What is Card Grid?

From e-commerce product lists to blog post archives, **Card Grid** is everywhere.
Its core requirements are:
1.  Consistent card size (or aspect ratio).
2.  **Responsive**: Show more columns on big screens (e.g., 4 cols), fewer on small screens (e.g., 1-2 cols).
3.  Even spacing.

## The Killer Feature: auto-fit + minmax

With CSS Grid, you can implement a perfect responsive layout with **one line of code**, often without needing any `@media` queries!

```css
.grid-container {
  display: grid;
  /* The Magic Line */
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 20px;
}
```

**Translation**:
*   `repeat(auto-fit, ...)`: Fit as many columns as possible in one row.
*   `minmax(250px, 1fr)`: Each column must be at least 250px wide. If there's extra space, distribute it equally (`1fr`).
*   If the screen is too narrow for another 250px column, it automatically wraps to the next line.
