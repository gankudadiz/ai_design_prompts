# Feature List

The **Feature List** is used to clearly showcase the key selling points of a product or service. It often uses a grid layout (2-4 items per row) or an alternating list, with each feature containing an icon, title, and short description.

## Implementation

CSS Grid is perfect for creating responsive feature grids that wrap automatically without media queries.

```css
.features-grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 2rem;
}

.feature-item {
  display: flex;
  flex-direction: column;
  align-items: center;
  text-align: center;
}
```
