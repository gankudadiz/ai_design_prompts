# What is Masonry?

Think of **Pinterest**. You'll notice images aren't in strict, even rows. Instead, they fit together like **bricks** in a wall, minimizing vertical gaps.

This is **Masonry Layout**. It's great for handling content of varying heights (like photos).

## How to build it?

It looks simple, but standard CSS Grids struggle with it.

### 1. The Easy Way (CSS Columns)
Like a newspaper. Content fills the first column top-to-bottom, then moves to the second.
*   **Downside**: Reading order is vertical, not horizontal.

### 2. The Best Way (JavaScript)
Most sites use JavaScript to calculate positions:
1.  Set up columns (e.g., 3 columns).
2.  Take the next item.
3.  Find the **shortest** column.
4.  Place the item there.
5.  Repeat.
