# What is Split Screen Layout?

Split Screen divides the viewport into two distinct areas (usually 50/50).
It's a modern, high-impact design choice often used for:
*   **Login/Signup Pages**: Brand image on one side, form on the other.
*   **Landing Pages**: Product close-up on one side, copy text on the other.

## Implementation

Flexbox is the best tool for this:

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  min-height: 100vh;
}

.left, .right {
  flex: 1; /* Equal width */
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center; /* Center content */
  align-items: center;
}

/* Mobile Adaptation: Stack vertically */
@media (max-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    flex-direction: column;
  }
}
```
